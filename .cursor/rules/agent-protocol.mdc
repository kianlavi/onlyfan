# Agent Operating Protocol

Read and follow `CLAUDE.md` at the project root before making any changes. It contains the full protocol. Key rules:

## Sub-Agent Orchestration

- Break complex tasks into independent sub-agent work units
- **Never let two sub-agents modify the same file concurrently** — partition files so each has exactly one owner at a time
- Sequence dependent work; parallelize only independent file changes

## Git Discipline

- **Commit after every meaningful unit of work** (bug fix, feature, refactor)
- Write clear imperative commit messages (≤72 char summary)
- **Push to origin immediately after every commit** — do not leave commits local-only
- Never force-push to main without explicit user approval

## Changelog

- After committing and pushing, **append an entry to the Version History section in `CLAUDE.md`**
- Format: `- **YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM** | <short summary of what changed and why>`

## Before Any Edit

- Read the file first
- Check `CLAUDE.md` for the file map and project context
- Keep the static site simple — no build tools or frameworks unless explicitly requested
